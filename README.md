# ospedit
OSPEdit is a (really) simple on-site source code editor, written in PHP

/!\ Warning, ospedit can browse for folders, wipe files and give access to your web site source code to anyone if misused (or not); use it at your own risk !!!

## Installation 
Just change the default password ("###_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE_###") and eventually the inclusion path of jquery/ui js and css scripts.

You can also download a copy of the excellent [ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/) to use syntax checking/highlighting. Just choose your ace type of distrib and place it in the right folder (default : js/src-min-noconflict/)
